# Brug Mine

A program that simulates the downtime activity of running a mining outpuost in a DnD campaign.

The program rolls a d20 for each mine that exits, rolls that number of d100 to determine what ore is found, and then rolls an associated quantity modifier dice to know how much. 
The program then reports back how much gold was made and the split between owner, ops, and employees that should be made according to a business plan.

## running

Use python3 main.py to run the program with data.csv in the working directory. Pass your own file as a command line arg using -d if you prefer.
